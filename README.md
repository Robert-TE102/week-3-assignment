Week 3 Assignment

My week 3 Reflection, I struggled with this big time, I had so much trouble trying to undertsand the basics of the DOM manipulation and to get the clicking for the upgrades to work, I eventually found out how to do it, and although it works, it is very barebones basic to the Cookie Clicker and any other idle clicker I found on the internet. I would like alot of feed back on how my HTML and javascript is structured,
what could I have done better?
could I have made it smaller and still function?
I spent so much time on doing the assignment I haven't had time to do my Cover Letter, hopefully i'll have sometime next week before the next assignment.
